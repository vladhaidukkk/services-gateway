# Services Gateway

This repository serves as an example of a [Monorepo](https://monorepo.tools) for web services
that share the same public API. It includes a gateway web service that sits in front of all the individual services.

The main goal was to develop a shared library that simplifies the process of creating, improving, and maintaining web
service public APIs, making it super primitive and easy to work with.
